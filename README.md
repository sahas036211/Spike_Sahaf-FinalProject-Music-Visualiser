# Rhythm & Karaoke Game
This project is a music-based game featuring three unique modes: **Rhythm Game**, **Karaoke Game**, and **Audio Visualisations**. 
## Features

### 1. Rhythm Game

- **Procedurally Generated Notes**: Notes are generated in time with the rhythm using a beat detection algorithm.
- **3D Note Animation**: Notes travel down lanes towards hit zones where players must press the corresponding keyboard keys.
- **Sync to Lyrics**: Notes are aligned with the lyrics of the song, and their lengths correspond to how long notes are held in the song.
- **Scoring System**: Points are awarded based on timing accuracy, with score, combo, and song time displayed during the game and at the end.
- **Pause Screen**: A pause menu includes a countdown mechanic for resuming or returning to the main menu.
- **Difficulty Settings**: Different difficulty levels adjust note spawn rates, offering varying levels of challenge.

### 2. Karaoke Game

- **Microphone Input**: Captures the player's voice and analyzes it, comparing pitch to the song’s notes.
- **Lyrics Display**: Shows the current and upcoming lyrics on the screen for players to follow.
- **Pitch Visualisation**: Displays the user’s pitch in real time, comparing it against target pitch zones.
- **Custom Backgrounds**: Webcam input changes the background, creating a personalized visual experience.
- **Scoring System**: Points are awarded based on pitch accuracy, with a final score shown at the end of the song.
- **Pause Screen**: Players can pause the game and resume it with a countdown.

### 3. Audio Visualisations

- **FFT-Based Visuals**: Uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to create patterns and shapes based on the audio or microphone input.
- **Interactive Controls**: Players can skip, pause, loop, or change the tempo of the song through controls.
- **Progress Bar**: A progress bar shows the current position of the song and allows users to skip forward or backward.
- **Webcam Input**: Customize the background with your webcam input.

### 4. Other Features
